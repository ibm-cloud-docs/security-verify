# Tenant Management

An IBM Verify instance is a logically separated environment. This means each instance is its own unique environment running in a multi tenant SaaS operational model. 

IBM Cloud accounts can create multiple IBM Verify instances. These instances are created with the defined capabilities corresponding to each of the plans. 

The IBM Verify instances allow for two operations, create and delete. Create allows the creation of a Verify instances to use when protecting consumer and workforce identities. Delete will suspend the instance for 7 days, allowing for recovery of data if accidentally deleted. If an instance is accidentally deleted and needs to be recovered, please reach out to IBM Cloud support.

After the 7th day, the instances will be deleted and data will not be recoverable.
